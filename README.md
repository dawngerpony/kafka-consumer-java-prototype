Kafka consumer prototype in Java
================================

A very simple demonstration of how to build a Kafka consumer in Java.

* More up to date than the other tutorials I found.
* Based off the official Javadocs rather than a random (old) tutorial.
* See the POM file for the exact Kafka version compatibility.

Prerequisites
-------------

* Java 8
* Maven

Getting started

    mvn package

Resources

* [Building a runnable jar with Maven 2](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2022032/building-a-runnable-jar-with-maven-2) - an excellent and concise description of how to build a runnable JAR file.
* [KafkaConsumer](https://kafka.apache.org/22/javadoc/index.html?org/apache/kafka/clients/consumer/KafkaConsumer.html) - Javadocs for the KafkaConsumer class
